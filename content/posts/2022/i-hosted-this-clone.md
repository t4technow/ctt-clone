## It's a clone

![](/images/2022/5-terminal-commands/tldr.png)

Too long didn't read? The perfect solution for long man pages that we just want some quick examples and basic syntax for a command. TLDR is a vital tool to save you time when learning the terminal. 

## CMatrix

How can you use Linux without using CMatrix... It's hard to be cool without it. 

## Trash-CLI

This is a life saver after you delete a directory or files in terminal and need to get them back. I highly recommend making the following alias in your `~/.bashrc` file. 

```
alias rm='trash -v'
```
